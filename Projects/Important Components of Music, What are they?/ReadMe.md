Project that is based on using random forest regression to analyze a music dataset. This data is based on music gathered from billboard.com. The music included in the dataset has a released date range from 1960-2015. Songs come from any genre, and songs have attached categories. These categories will allow for an easier breakdown of song structure. 
The purpose of this project is to discover what is the correct structure a song should have to ensure the best possibility of achieving high charting status based on music sales.
