This is my project, which is centered around social media exploration. The intent was to gain sentiment rating insight from web scraping data from Twitter. The resulting data set was under 100k rows, and the information included items such as a Twitter user's comment, the topic of discussion, the sentiment, etc. There was a wide range of topics and varying posting comment lengths. Overall, this project went smoothly as, in the end, when testing on the validation dataset, the results were excellent. Thus, I could use this framework to move to the next step of the project's usage, whatever that may be.
