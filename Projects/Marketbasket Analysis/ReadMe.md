# This project is based on performing market basket analysis. This type of analysis is typically performed in the retail sector and used to track sales information. During this project, the big picture of what I was trying to accomplish involved building a system that tracks product sales information. This sales information was done by monitoring metrics such as item quantity sold and how much each item was sold for. Each unique transaction aggregates the sales information; for example, if you select transaction one on a specific date, you would have what items were purchased in that transaction. Data organized this way allowed the user to select a target item. Over the selected date range, you can see how the item performed regarding sales, and you would be able to see what items were purchased alongside the target item. Gaining this insight would allow leaders to, for example, see how a sales promotion is performing and if they would need to adjust based on history.
