# This project is more of a display of interest; it came from the beginning of my data science adventures. The topic of discussion is related to human and machine symbiosis. I thought this would be an interesting topic because I feel the further data science progresses, the more likely this relationship will start to happen. Some of the contents that are spoken about touch on things, such as using artificial intelligence to perform tasks that would possibly allow safety checks if there is something like human augmentation being used. An example of this could be something of an intelligent pacemaker; it could, for example, be well ahead of the curve of a possible incident happening to the user. While this project may not be the most in-depth and there wasn't much code used, if any at all, I think it is a good piece to look back on and reflect on where it all started.
